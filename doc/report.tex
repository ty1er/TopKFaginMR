\section{Description}

Our goal for this project was to implement Fagin Algorithm for searching top-k element in dataset on distributed MapReduce environment.
We used Hadoop as a MapReduce framework, therefore all source code is written in Java.
The rest of the report is organized as follows: Section \ref{sec:preprocess} is describing initial datasets preprocessing approach, Section \ref{sec:iterative} presents na\"{\i}ve implementation of Fagin algorithm using Hadoop, Section \ref{sec:mapreduce} provides detail description of our MapReduce approach, Section \ref{sec:experiments} shows experimental results.

\section{Preprocessing}
\label{sec:preprocess}

Since the initial datasets are unordered and have different attribute ranges we need to do initial data preprocessing in order to start Fagin algorithm.
Preprocessing step could we done in a different way, as opposed to the target algorithm (i.e. running special script on dataset file), but this limits program's portability and brings additional steps to run it, therefore we implemented preprocessing step also as a MapReduce job, which prepares data for subsequent jobs (since their execution is chained).
Results presented in Section \ref{sec:experiments} do not include execution time of this step.

Dataset preprocessing could be divided into several parts:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Attribute range normalization
		Attribute values from dataset1 lie in range [-1;1], which is not appropriate range for calculating object score, because our score function is additive and adding attributes which have values less then 0 do not maintain monotonic increase property.
		
		In order to normalize attribute values we just add 1 to every item.
		This will result in attribute values having range [0;2], which satisfies monotonic condition, however we need to take into account this fact when we will calculate final score for top-k objects and subtract extra 1's from this result. The value that we should add (which is 1) differs for various datasets (dataset2 doesn't need normalization at all), therefore it is passed as an optional runtime parameter, which default value is 0.  

		This process is done in map phase of rank soring preprocess step.
	\item Attribute filtering
		Since our score function looks like this $f(t) = sum( t.attr1, t.attr2, t.attr7, t.attr8, t.attr9)$ and does not include every object's attribute we need to filter them out.

		This process done in map phase of the next rank soring preprocess step.
 	\item Attribute rank sorting
 		For Fagin algorithm objects need to be sorted in decreasing order of their attribute values separately for each individual attribute.

 		This sorting us done as a distinct MapReudce job. 
 		In a map phase we are extracting objects along with their property values and emitting pairs \{propId:value,objectId:value\}:    
 		\lstinputlisting[language=java,linerange={55-56,58-58,60-60}]{../src/main/java/edu/ucr/cs236/RankSorting.java}
 		
 		The reason why we duplicate attribute value in key is the following: Hadoop is capable of sorting key-value pairs in reducer, but this sorting could be applied only to key. Later these pairs are sorted during shuffle phase against the value in sortComparator, before they are passer to reducer:
		\lstinputlisting[language=java,linerange={99-102}]{../src/main/java/edu/ucr/cs236/RankSorting.java}
 		
 		However by default MapReduce framework will call reducer for each different key (which is propId:value). In order to redirect pairs with the same propId we implement custom partitioner:
 		\lstinputlisting[language=java,linerange={129-130}]{../src/main/java/edu/ucr/cs236/RankSorting.java}

 		Reduce phase is simply writing already sorted results with the appropriate line number (we will use this line number later): 
 		\lstinputlisting[language=java,linerange={74-78}]{../src/main/java/edu/ucr/cs236/RankSorting.java}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Iterative algorithm}
\label{sec:iterative}

The very first version we devised tried to implement iterative approach (reading input line by line and maintaining list of objects seen so far) of the original Fagin algorithm on Hadoop.
This was a straightforward implementation in terms of algorithm modification, however we faced several problems while doing this:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If we want to implement each iteration as distinct MapReduce job we need to came up with the input and output file format.
    These formats should be the same, because output of $i^{th}$ iteration is an input of $i+1^{th}$, which is not trivial thing to do.
    \item Even after resolving file format issue we encountered another problem: in iterative approach each iteration need to do IO operations, reading it's input from HSDF and writing it's result back to disk.
    With the large datasets this becomes a major issue, which could be addressed only by changing Hadoop algorithm.
\end{enumerate}

With all these problems we realized that we need to make a number of improvements to the original algorithm in order to execute it on Hadoop in effective manner.
Special attention should be paid to IO, since it is the limiting factor for MapReduce tasks.
